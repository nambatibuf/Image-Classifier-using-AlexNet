# MATLAB Image Classification Project

This repository contains a simple MATLAB project for image classification using the AlexNet model.

## Overview

The project utilizes the pre-trained AlexNet model to classify images. It reads an input image, ensures it has 3 channels (RGB), adjusts the size, and then classifies the image using AlexNet. The classification results are displayed alongside the original image.

## Prerequisites

- MATLAB installed
- Image Processing Toolbox
- Deep Learning Toolbox
- AlexNet pre-trained model

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nambatibuf/Image-Classifier-using-AlexNet.git
   cd your-repository

2. Open the Script

3. Run the Script
